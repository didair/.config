### Extend the configuration
Want to make your own changes that doesnt affect the repository?

Create a file named `.vimrc.local` in the `~/.config` directory, all settings made
in that file will overwrite the settings in this repo.

## Todo
1. Write a very simple installation script that creates the symlinks needed.
2. Also include python setup etc. In the installation section of this readme
